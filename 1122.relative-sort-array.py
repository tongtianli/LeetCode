# Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19]\n[2,1,4,3,9,6]'
#
# Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all
# elements in arr2 are also in arr1.
# 
# Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1
# are the same as in arr2. Elements that do not appear in arr2 should be placed
# at the end of arr1 in ascending order.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
# Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: arr1 = [28,6,22,8,44,17], arr2 = [22,28,8,6]
# Output: [22,28,8,6,17,44]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
# 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000
# All the elements of arr2 are distinct.
# EachÂ arr2[i] is in arr1.
#

class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        weight = { num : i for i, num in enumerate(arr2) }
        return sorted(arr1, key=lambda x: weight[x] if x in weight else x + 1000)
